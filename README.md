# Preview of the project
This project is written in C as a low-level program that reads a csv file and asks for commands from the user such as display data, sort the data based on a column, analyze a column and plotting the data of one or many columns on a vertical graph. 
This code was written without the use of malloc, realloc and structure typedef.
